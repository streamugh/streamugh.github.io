            <p>With excellent communication and organization skills, I have proven my ability to effectively convey ideas and coordinate tasks. As a co-leader of the Shared Knowledge wiki club, I've successfully organized and conducted several workshops with over 50 students, demonstrating my capacity to lead and engage large groups. Through my involvement with the Volunteers Center Skopje, I have delivered speeches on environmental and social issues, showcasing my passion for making a positive impact.
                My participation in Erasmus+ projects and tourism-related internships has provided me with extensive cultural exchange experience, highlighting my adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills. Complementing these experiences, my university classes and active participation in webinars have equipped me with substantial business knowledge, particularly in the realms of marketing and management. My enthusiasm for business and marketing is further evident through my involvement in a marketing internship, where I have gained practical experience and honed my skills in the field.</p>
